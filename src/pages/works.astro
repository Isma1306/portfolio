      <p>This is a project I started as a joke. I read that HTMX is terrible for very interactive apps, so I wanted to see how far I could push it. I thought, "Let's test that out..."</p>
      <p>
        To test this, I created a classic Snake game using WebSockets, HTMX, and templates written in Go. The only extra dependency is Gorilla WebSocket. On the frontend, I aimed for zero JavaScript,
        but I needed event listeners for keyboard input, everything else is pure HTMX <em>magic</em>. I didn't focus much on styling, so I owe you that part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I added multiplayer support for up to four players. Since I was playing often with friends, I decided to implement more features and improve the functionality like lobby creation,
        join/invite support, and the ability to rejoin a game after disconnection.
      </p>
      <p>
        To maintain performance under these self-imposed constraints, I only send each client the squares that change on every tick, rather than the entire board. I also use go routines for the game
        loops, channel for send data between them and some mutexes to avoid race conditions <em>the Go data race detector is amazing :chefkiss:</em>.
      </p>
      <p>The entire Docker image is around 20MB. I tested it with 10 full lobbies running simultaneously, and it was still using only about 12MB of RAM, so I consider that a success.</p>

      <p>I wanted to have an easy way to check the wet bulb temperature for the day so I know the best time to run or if it will be dangerously hot</p>
      <p>
        For that I used the <a href='https://open-meteo.com/'>open weather API</a> and calculated the wet bulb temperature using the formula from
        <a href='https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/50/11/jamc-d-11-0143.1.xml'>ametsoc.org</a>. I also added a simple chart to visualize the temperature throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used go to fetch the info from <a href='https://open-meteo.com/'>open weather API</a> the and calculate the wet bulb temperature. For the frontend I used solidjs because I wanted to try it and
        I really like it, loved the signal implementation, how light and fast it is. Great DX.
